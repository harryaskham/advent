# Advent of Code

Solutions to Advent of Code problems in Haskell.

- 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2020 are fully completed. I aimed for idiomatic and relatively clean solutions.
- 2019 is unfinished and the quality of solutions is a little poorer, as I started learning Haskell while doing AOC 2019 in real-time.

The modules `Coord` and `Grid` contain various tools for working with 2D and 3D grids, and `Utils` contains a grab-bag of generally AOC-friendly tooling.
