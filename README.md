# Advent of Code

Solutions to Advent of Code problems in Haskell.

- 2020 and 2017 are completed. I aimed for idiomatic and relatively clean solutions.
- 2016 is partially complete, as above.
- 2018 is messily solved until Day 10, where I revisited it and aimed for clean solutions thereafter. The rest is partially complete.
- 2019 is messily solved until Day 19. I'll revisit this last.
