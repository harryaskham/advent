# Advent of Code

Solutions to Advent of Code problems in Haskell.

- 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2020 are fully completed. I aimed for idiomatic and relatively clean solutions.
- 2015 is unstarted.
- 2019 is messily solved until Day 19 (this was the first year I attempted, in real-time, while still learning Haskell). I'll revisit this last, clean it up, and finish it.

The modules `Coord` and `Grid` contain various tools for working with 2D and 3D grids, and `Utils` contains a grab-bag of generally AOC-friendly tooling.
