# Advent of Code

Solutions to Advent of Code problems in Haskell.

- 2017, 2018 and 2020 are fully completed. I aimed for idiomatic and relatively clean solutions.
- 2016 is partially complete, to the same standards as above.
- 2019 is messily solved until Day 19. I'll revisit this last.
- 2015 is unstarted.
