#+TITLE: Advent of Code Solutions

Complete solutions to Advent of Code problems in Haskell.

All years are fully completed. I aimed for idiomatic and relatively clean solutions before 2022 then moved to a custom prelude and prioritised fun

The modules ~Coord~ and ~Grid~ contain various tools for working with 2D and 3D grids, and ~Utils~ contains a grab-bag of generally AOC-friendly tooling. ~Tracers~ has a bunch of useful printf-debugging utilities augmenting ~Debug.Trace~.

2015 through 2020 are contained in one huge Stack project; this has become impossible to upgrade, and is pegged to GHC 8.6.5, which doesn't work well with new versions of OS X. This is now archived; it should still be runnable with 8.6.5 (and ~stack --nix~ should work as long as 8.6.5's tarball remains), but I expect this will bit-rot over time.

Going forwards from 2021, each year is its own Nix-managed Cabal project.
