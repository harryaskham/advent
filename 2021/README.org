#+TITLE: Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

* Running
- To run with Nix, ~nix-build release.nix && result/bin/x2021~
- To run with Cabal, just ~cabal run~
- To keep these in sync, ~cabal2nix . > default.nix~
  -  For a one-liner, ~cabal2nix . > default.nix && nix-build release.nix && result/bin/x2021~
- For GHCi, ~cabal v2-repl~

* Profiling
Generate profiling stats with ~cabal v2-run --enable-profiling exes --  +RTS -p~

* Adding New Modules
- For every new module added, ~x2021.cabal~ needs updating then we also need to run ~~/.cabal/bin/gen-hie . > hie.yaml~ for HLS to pick the file up.
